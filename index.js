				`You will write a JavaScript program which uses loops and if statements to create a modular generative pattern. You will design at least one single pattern unit (a module) (think: div) that changes over the course of its output.`,
				`Your unit should iterate at least 100 times. With each iteration, your unit should somehow modify itself (content or css attributes: size, color, rotation, shape, texture). Your pattern should have at least 2 variables of change (ex: content, color), is allowed to repeat itself (i.e. be a pattern), and is allowed to be as abstract or literal as you want (it can tell a story, or it can be an exercise in form). The goal of this project is to use javascript to dynamically append HTML elements and programmatically alter their attributes. This project will also utilize javascript to explore techniques of animation and interactivity.`
