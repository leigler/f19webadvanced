					<ul>
						<li>How you might successfully show the different aspects of your pattern&rsquo;s interface.</li>
						<li>How you might communicate what you were interested in originally and how the pattern has evolved.</li>

					paragraphs: [
					`For next week you will evolve your pattern to its final form by introducing at least two interactive elements.`,
				`These interactive elements should utilize the eventListeners or inline functions reviewed in class and should allow your pattern to transcend into an experimental interface:`,
				`Questions to consider include:
				<ul>
				<li>Does the pattern itself exist as an interface, or is the interface layered on top of it?</li>
				<li>Can we see the entire interface, or is it somehow embedded in our interaction with the site (i.e. does the interface consist of buttons or does our scroll produce a direct response)?</li>
				<li>How might the interface question our expectations?</li>
				<li>What about the pattern is revealed to the user through their interaction?</li>
				</ul>`

						`For next week, please evolve your pattern to animate using either <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>setInterval</code>. Consider how the introduction of movement influences your pattern&rsquo;s reveal.`,
						`Will you introduce easing via the css <code>transition</code> or <code>@keyframe</code> attributes? Will the site animate as it fills or will individual units animate on their own?`,
						`How will your animation influence how we understand the window&rsquo;s spatial dimensions?`

				`You will write a JavaScript program which uses loops and if statements to create a modular generative pattern. You will design at least one single pattern unit (a module) (think: div) that changes over the course of its output.`,
				`Your unit should iterate at least 100 times. With each iteration, your unit should somehow modify itself (content or css attributes: size, color, rotation, shape, texture). Your pattern should have at least 2 variables of change (ex: content, color), is allowed to repeat itself (i.e. be a pattern), and is allowed to be as abstract or literal as you want (it can tell a story, or it can be an exercise in form). The goal of this project is to use javascript to dynamically append HTML elements and programmatically alter their attributes. This project will also utilize javascript to explore techniques of animation and interactivity.`
