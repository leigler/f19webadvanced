				`This exercise&rsquo;s goal is to increase your comfort with saving and retrieving data from your browser&rsquo;s <code>localStorage</code>.`,
				`For this exercise, please create two interactions (i.e. create two eventListeners) with visual outputs that are somehow juxtaposed.`,
				`To utilize the <code>localStorage</code>, each interaction should update your localStorage item (<code>localStorage.setItem('favCeleb', 'Grumpy Cat');</code>), and each page refresh should check and update your site with your localStorage item&rsquo;s data (<code>localStorage.getItem('favCeleb');</code>).`,
				`Don&rsquo;t forget to convert your data into the correct type (integer, json, boolean) if necessary!`,
				`For a refresher, you can read through the Mozilla docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">here</a> or find the past lecture and demo files <a href="../lectures/index.html">here</a>.`,
				`<br><br>Examples include: <ul>
					<li>Two buttons that respectively increase and decrease a circle&rsquo;s size.</li>
					<li>An array of words or phrases that are selected and re-ordered on a canvas.</li>
					<li>A simple drawing + erasing tool.</li>
					<li>A cross-session stopwatch.</li>
